See all of our SDKs and integrations on the [Vonage Developer portal](https://developer.vonage.com/en/tools).

## Installation

Releases are published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.vonage/server-sdk).
Instructions for your build system can be found in the snippets section.
We *strongly recommend* that you use a tool that supports dependency management,
such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/).

Release notes for each version can be found in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Here are the instructions for including the SDK in your project:

### Gradle
Add the following to your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.vonage:server-sdk:9.2.0")
}
```

### Maven
Add the following to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vonage</groupId>
    <artifactId>server-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>9.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Build It Yourself

Alternatively you can clone the repo and build the JAR file yourself:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vonage/vonage-java-sdk.git
mvn install -P uberjar
```

The `uberjar` profile will create a JAR file with all dependencies required to run the SDK included,
which can be found in the `target` directory. The `install` goal will make the SDK and its dependencies
available in your local Maven repository (usually located under your `~/.m2` directory), which can then
be used from other projects locally on your machine. To use this in a Gradle project, you need to include
the dependency co-ordinates and add `mavenLocal()` to the `repositories` block in your `build.gradle` file.

### Custom Requests
Beginning with v9.1.0, you can now make customisable requests to any Vonage API endpoint using the `CustomClient` class,
obtained from the `VonageClient#getCustomClient()` method. This will take care of auth and serialisation for you.
You can use existing data models from the SDK or create your own by extending `com.vonage.client.JsonableBaseObject`
or implementing the `com.vonage.client.Jsonable` interface. For example, you can check your account balance using
the following code, which will send a `get` request to the specified URL and return a `BalanceResponse` object:

```java
BalanceResponse response = client.getCustomClient().get("https://rest.nexmo.com/account/get-balance");
```

You can also parse the response into a `Map<String, ?>` which represents the JSON response body as a tree like so:

```java
Map<String, ?> response = client.getCustomClient().get("https://api-eu.vonage.com/v3/media?order=ascending&page_size=50");
```

The same applies for `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests when sending data.
You can mix and match between `java.util.Map` and `com.vonage.client.Jsonable` interfaces for request and response bodies.
For example, to create an application, you can use any of the following (all are equivalent):

#### Map request, Map response
```java
Map<String, ?> response = client.getCustomClient().post(
        "https://api.nexmo.com/v2/applications",
        Map.of("name", "Demo Application")
);
```

#### Map request, Jsonable response
```java
Application response = client.getCustomClient().post(
        "https://api.nexmo.com/v2/applications",
        Map.of("name", "Demo Application")
);
```

#### Jsonable request, Map response
```java
Map<String, ?> response = client.getCustomClient().post(
        "https://api.nexmo.com/v2/applications",
        Application.builder().name("Demo Application").build()
);
```

#### Jsonable request, Jsonable response
```java
Application response = client.getCustomClient().post(
        "https://api.nexmo.com/v2/applications",
        Application.builder().name("Demo Application").build()
);
```

#### Supported response types
The `<R>` parameter in the response type methods does not have to be a `Map<String, ?>` or `Jsonable`; it can also
be a `String`, `byte[]` (for binary types) or `Collection` (for JSON arrays). The following will work, for example:

```java
String response = client.getCustomClient().get("https://example.com");
```

#### Advanced Usage
The `CustomClient` provides preset methods for the supported HTTP request types and JSON-based request bodies.
However, if you would like to make a request with non-JSON body (e.g. binary data), you can use the `makeRequest` method.
This is a more convenient way of using `com.vonage.client.DynamicEndpoint` which takes care of most of the setup for you.

#### Caveats
Whilst the `CustomClient` class is a powerful tool, it is not intended to be a replacement for dedicated support
which the SDK provides for Vonage APIs. Furthermore, you may notice your IDE giving warnings like
"Unchecked generics array creation for varargs parameter". This is because all methods in `CustomClient` use a 
varargs parameter for the response type as a way to infer the response type without you having to explicitly provide
the `Class<R>` parameter. This is a known limitation of Java generics and is not a problem with the SDK itself, it is
implemented this way for your convenience. As per the documentation, it is important to not pass any value for this
varargs parameter â€” just omit it. If you do pass a value, the SDK will not be able to infer the response type.
You should also always use explicit assignment for the `CustomClient` methods, as the SDK will not be able to infer the return type if you use `var` or `Object`.
If you do not assign the response to a typed variable explicitly, `Void` will be inferred and the method will return `null`.

## Configuration

## Typical Instantiation
For default configuration, you just need to specify your Vonage account credentials using API key and secret, private
key and application ID or both. For maximum compatibility with all APIs, it is recommended that you specify both
authentication methods, like so:

```java
VonageClient client = VonageClient.builder()
        .applicationId(APPLICATION_ID)
        .privateKeyPath(PRIVATE_KEY_PATH)
        .apiKey(API_KEY)
        .apiSecret(API_SECRET)
        .build();
```

### Customize the Base URI
By default, the client will use https://api.nexmo.com, https://rest.nexmo.com,  https://api-eu.vonage.com and https://video.api.vonage.com as base URIs for the various endpoints. To customize these you can instantiate `VonageClient` with an `HttpConfig` object.

`HttpConfig.Builder` has been created to assist in building this object. Usage is as follows:

```java
HttpConfig httpConfig = HttpConfig.builder()
        .apiBaseUri("https://api.example.com")
        .restBaseUri("https://rest.example.com")
        .apiEuBaseUri("https://api-eu.example.com")
        .videoBaseUri("https://video.example.com")
        .build();

VonageClient client = VonageClient.builder()
        .apiKey(API_KEY).apiSecret(API_SECRET)
        .httpConfig(httpConfig)
        .build();
```

If you do not specify a property, it will take on whatever the default value is. You can also set all three with a single method:

```java
HttpConfig httpConfig = HttpConfig.builder().baseUri("http://example.com").build();

VonageClient client = VonageClient.builder()
        .apiKey(API_KEY).apiSecret(API_SECRET)
        .httpConfig(httpConfig)
        .build();
```

### Custom Timeout

By default, the SDK has a 1-minute timeout for requests.
You can change this to be longer or shorter using `HttpConfig`. The following example sets this to 12 seconds:

```java
VonageClient client = VonageClient.builder()
        .applicationId(APPLICATION_ID)
        .privateKeyPath(PRIVATE_KEY_PATH)
        .httpConfig(HttpConfig.builder().timeoutMillis(12_000).build())
        .build();
```

### Logging

The SDK uses [Java's built-in logging library (`java.util.logging`)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html) to log requests and responses.
This is primarily centralised in two places: [AbstractMethod](src/main/java/com/vonage/client/AbstractMethod.java)
and [DynamicEndpoint](src/main/java/com/vonage/client/DynamicEndpoint.java).
For most cases, the former should provide sufficient level of detail.
It can be activated by setting the logger level to `FINE`, like so:

```java
LogManager.getLogManager().getLogger("com.vonage.client.AbstractMethod").setLevel(Level.FINE);
```

Since the logger on `DynamicEndpoint` is not static and based on the class name, it will only be activated if the
global log level is set to `FINE`. You can set the global log level like so:

```java
LogManager.getLogManager().getLogger("").setLevel(Level.FINE);
```

This will also activate the logger on `AbstractMethod` if you haven't already specified the desired log level on
that class, so you don't need to set it separately.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happened to [`com.vonage:client`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.vonage/client)?**

**A:** To avoid confusion with our various client-side SDKs, this server-side SDK has been moved from
the `com.vonage:client` coordinates to `com.vonage:server-sdk`. The old artifactId (`com.vonage:client`) will
not receive further updates. All users should migrate to the new artifactId. Please note that the SDK is functionally
the same, it is just a namespace change on Maven Central.

**Q: What is your policy on thread safety?**

**A:** The current architecture of the SDK means that only one thread should use the client at a time.
If you would like to use the SDK in a multithreaded environment, create a separate instance of
`VonageClient` for each thread.

**Q: Does this SDK support asynchronous request / response processing?**

**A:** Currently no, but it is [on the roadmap](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk/issues/269).

**Q: I'm having issues with my project when including the SDK as a dependency. How can I troubleshoot this?**

**A:** Please see [this blog post](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/one-simple-trick-for-resolving-java-runtime-dependency-issues).
In short, you may have conflicting dependency versions in your project which clash with this SDK's transitive dependencies.

**Q: I'm encountering HTTP request issues, such as timeouts. How can I remedy or report this?**

**A:** This SDK uses [Apache HTTP Client 4](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html) under the
hood, so you may be able to use system properties to configure the client, or use this SDK's `httpConfig` method on
the `Vonage` class  for more fine-grained control. If you believe there is an issue with the underlying client, please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk/issues/new/choose) with a minimal reproducible example,
including details of your environment (JVM runtime version, SDK version, operating system etc.)

**Q: I'm not sure if my issue is with the SDK. How can I get help?**

**A:** Please see our [support page](https://api.support.vonage.com/), including contact information.

**Q: How do I migrate from TokBox to Vonage?**

**A:** See [the OpenTok migration guide](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/transition-guides/server-sdks/java).
