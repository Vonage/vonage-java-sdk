### Added
- Added support for updating account settings (delivery receipt URL and inbound SMS URL)
- Added support for [Async Number Insights](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/number-insight#getNumberInsightAsync) by setting the property `async` and `callback` on the `AdvancedInsightRequest` object.
- Add `ringback` support to the `onAnswer` part of the `PhoneEndpoint`.

### Changed
- Changed from Auth0 to the [Nexmo JWT Library](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-jwt-jdk).
- Renamed the `com.nexmo.client.applications` package to `com.nexmo.client.application`
- `ApplicationClient` now supports the [Applications v2](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/application.v2) API. This change has resulted in some backwards incompatibility.
- `NexmoClientException` is now a `RuntimeException`. The various sub client methods will still declare that it is being thrown, but it is no longer a requirement to catch the exception. Additionally, the `IOException` that was being thrown in each method has been converted to a `NexmoResponseParseException` to more accurately reflect when it is thrown. This is also an unchecked exception and catching is no longer required.
- The `NexmoUnacceptableAuthException` will now add which parameters are missing instead of which internal auth methods.

### Added
- Missing builders for `StreamAction`, `AdvancedInsightRequest`, `StandardInsightRequest`, and `BasicInsightRequest`.

### Fixed
- `AbstractMethod` will force UTF-8 charset for requests using `StringEntity`.
- Tests will now run using static builder methods for each of the classes that use builders for construction.

## [4.1.0] - 2019-03-15

### Added
- Added static `builder` methods to `Action` classes to reduce some of the verbosity around using them. You can now do `TalkAction action = TalkAction.builder("Hello World!").build();` instead of just `TalkAction action = new TalkAction.Builder("Hello World).build();`.
- Added static `builder` methods to `NexmoClient` to reduce some of the verbosity around instantiating the client.
- Added `ncco` property to the `Call` object for use in the `VoiceClient.createCall` method. You can now send an `Ncco` directly to the API instead of defining an `answer_url`.
## [4.0.1] - 2018-11-21

### Added
- `channels` property to `RecordAction` as it was unintentionally removed during the version 4 release.

## [4.0.0] - 2018-11-16

### Added
- Added `Ncco` class to wrap `Collection<Action>` and handle the serialization of NCCO json through `toJson`.
- Added the following `Builder` classes:
  - `ConnectAction.Builder`
  - `ConversationAction.Builder`
  - `InputAction.Builder`
  - `RecordAction.Builder`
  - `StreamAction.Builder`
  - `TalkAction.Builder`

- Added `WebSocketEndpoint` to `com.nexmo.voice.ncco` package for use with `ConnectAction`.
- Added `SipEndpoint` to `com.nexmo.voice.ncco` package for use with `ConnectAction`.

- Added `EventType` enumeration and the ability to specify the `eventType` property of `ConnectAction`.
- Added `NexmoClient.Builder` to allow for fluent creation of `NexmoClient`.
- Added `getBasicNumberInsight`, `getStandardNumberInsight`, and `getAdvancedNumberInsight` to `InsightClient` which takes a respective `*InsightRequest`.
- Added `CallerIdentity` data object to be used in number insight.
- Added `Builder` to `CallsFilter` class to make filtering search results more intuative.

### Changed
- Renamed all `Ncco` classes to `Action` classes:
  - Renamed `Ncco` interface to `Action`
  - Renamed `ConnectNcco` to `ConnectAction`
  - Renamed `ConversationNcco` to `ConversationAction`
  - Renamed `InputNcco` to `InputAction`
  - Renamed `RecordNcco` to `RecordAction`
  - Renamed `StreamNcco` to `StreamAction`
  - Renamed `TalkNcco` to `TalkAction`
- All `Action` classes now must be constructed through the provided `Builder` class.

- `VerifyClient` will now return `*Response` instead of `*Result` objects.
- Refactored `com.nexmo.client.voice.endpoints` to be part of the `com.nexmo.client.voice` package.
- Made all `*Endpoint` and `*Method` classes package scoped. Users should always go through the appropriate `Client` classes.
- Moved `AbstractMethod` to the root package.
- Removed legacy `setUri` methods from the various `VoiceClient` endpoints. This should be done through `HttpConfig`.
- Changed `BasicInsightRequest`, `StandardInsightRequest`, and `AdvancedInsightRequest` to use builders as constructor
  telescoping is clunky. Added some static factory methods to these classes to allow shortcutting through the builder for "simple" requests.
- Updated `BasicInsightEndpoint`, `StandardInsightEndpoint`, and `AdvancedInsightEndpoint` to a more restrictive scope and moved them to the `com.nexmo.client.insight` package.
- Changed `status` property of `BasicInsightResponse` to an `InsightStatus` enumeration.
- Changed `SendMessageEndpoint` from XML to JSON. It now returns a `SmsSubmissionResponse` instead of an array result.

### Changed
